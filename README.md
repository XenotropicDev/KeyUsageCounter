# KeyUsageCounter
A open source key counter for tracking keyboard usage.

This is an open source project that will hopefully give you a better idea of how you use your keyboard.

This program is still in its initial development. It is lacking several features that hopefully I will add soon. The bulk of the logic comes from this microsoft article: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/toub/2006/05/03/low-level-keyboard-hook-in-c/

Planned features:
* Multiple file logging options (1 per session, day, hour, one file to rule them all)
* Counting multiple key inputs
* Counting Key Down and Key Up events
* Integration with keyboard-layout-editor.com for heat maps
